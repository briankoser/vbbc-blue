            Victory Bible Baptist Church is an Independent,	Fundamental, Bible-Preaching, Missionary-minded Church. We believe that God's Word provides the 		         
            only solid foundation on which to build our lives. We believe that God has a purpose for every life and	that is why we make no apology for teaching 
            and preaching the Bible. We use only the King James Version for all our teaching and preaching services. 
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>Our heart felt prayer is for you to know Jesus Christ as your personal Saviour and become involved in a church home that cares for you.</p>
        <br />

        <p>
            We invite you to visit our church where you will receive a warm and friendly welcome. If you have any questions or if we can be of assistance, please 
            email or call anytime. May God bless you.
