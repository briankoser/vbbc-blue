<p>My wife and I would like to personally invite you to visit our church family here at Victory.</p>

<p>We will extend a warm welcome to you among our friendly and caring people.</p>

<p>
    We strive to worship the Lord, share each others burdens, and encourage one another as we sing the praises of our Saviour Jesus Christ and 
    hear God speak to us through His Word as it is preached each service.
</p>

<p>Once again, please come visit and be a part of our services.</p>

<p>May God richly bless you,</p>

<p>Pastor Allen Cotton</p>
